# K1tsune

K1tsune is an in-development programming language. planned to be simple to learn, hard to master. I imagine K1tsune to look like a mixture of Javascript and Go. specifically DiscordGo as it has a very easy-to-read design. the idea of K1tsune started in a conversation i had with a friend (he goes by KoukouDev, you should go check him out, and he's way better than YandereDev.) about his game (Koukou Dabora!). despite me starting the idea, Dev actually motivated me into turning this idea into a possible reality.


## Getting started

as this is still in development, i haven't even gotten started myself.

### Prerequisites

```

```

### Installation

```

```

### Testing

unsurprisingly, 

```
also a placeholder.
```

### How your code should look

were you expecting a placeholder?
you're correctly incorrect.

the code was imagined to, as i said previously to look like a mix of JS and DiscordGo.
```
{%var := "variable"};

{if eq %var `variable`}
{%var};
{else}

{end};
```
i hope that gave you an idea. as you can see `;` only appear at the end of every complete function.

## How can you use this

you can use this in many ways. since it's easy to learn you can use it in simple functions and even discord bots if someone adapts it to discord. an example of the hard to master part is if someone is advanced enough to put it applications and games, possibly create another programming language with it.
like that's ever gonna happen.

## Built with
I made this with Go, little experience with coding outside of Discord.Go and JEdit.
